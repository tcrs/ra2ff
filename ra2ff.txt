                    --- Red Alert 2 File Format Guide ---
                                  - shiny -

This document describes several of the file formats used by the "Command &
Conquer: Red Alert 2" computer game by Westwood.  Note that some of the
described formats have the same name as in other versions of C&C (TS, TD,
etc.) - but many are different formats.

I do not intend to take credit for the majority of the information in this
document, I've merely collected, clarified & tested it.

You'll also notice that I have not documented the MIX file format - this
format has been covered plenty in other documentation, and I'm not interested
in writing a reader for it.

****                       ----=| Versions |=-----

2008-08-10 ................................................................. 1
        - Initial write up (VXL / HVA / PAL)

2008-08-14 ................................................................. 2
        - Added SHP format (needs more research)

2008-08-17 ................................................................. 3
        - Added TMP format (basic info only)
        - Added file type determination section

2008-08-18 ................................................................. 4
        - Realised that TMP format is complicated, and Olaf van der Spek's
          document on the format is out of date - had to resort to the xcc
          source code
2008-08-19 ................................................................. 5
        - Wrote up what I discovered about the TMP format from the xcc code,
          mostly complete.
        - Started work on map format, going is tough.
2008-08-20 ................................................................. 6
        - More work on map format, worked out from XCC code how to decompress
          IsoMapPack5 & PreviewPack.  Need to work out Overlay*Pack.
2008-08-21 ................................................................. 7
        - Can decompress all packed sections in the map now
        - Decompressed Overlay*Pack format.  Looks like it might be the same
          as RA - one byte per tile in the map.
        - Need to work out what tiles correspond to each ID in both
          IsoMapPack5 and Overlay*Pack

****                     -----=| Data widths |=------

All multi-byte values stored in the files are stored little-endian (LSB first)

A byte is 8 bits.
A float is a 4-byte IEE754 floating point number (i.e. single precision)
int8, int16, int32 , int64 are signed integers 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits wide
uint8, uint16, uint32 , uint64 are unsigned integers 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits wide
type[n] is an array of n 'type's
type[n][m] is an 2d array of n x m 'type's, stored row-major (C-style)

****                -----=| Determining file types |=-----

There are several file types in RA2.  The main method of determining the file
type is the file extension (which is what most of the types are named after).

.vxl = VXL
.hva = HVA
.pal = PAL
.shp = SHP
.tem = SHP/TMP *
.urb = SHP/TMP *
.sno = SHP/TMP *
.map = Map (stored as an INI file, with some Base64 encoded binary sections)

* These files are theatre-specific, so the file extension is the theatre
mnemonic.  This does add some confusion, as these files can be either SHPs or
TMPs.  The best way I have found of determining which type they are is to
check the first 16 bits of the file; if it is zero then the file is a SHP,
otherwise it is a TMP.

****                         -----=| VXL |=-----

A vxl file contains a representation of a three-dimensional object, using a
voxel representation.  A voxel is a "volumetric pixel,"  in the same way that
a pixel represents a square in a two-dimensional image, a voxel represents a
cube in a three-dimensional image.

VXLFile {
        header         : Header
        sectionHeaders : SectionHeader[header.numSections]
        -- The sectionData is header.bodySize bytes long
        sectionData    : SectionData[header.numSections]
        sectionTailers : SectionTailer[header.numSections]
}

Header {
        -- Always equal to the string "Voxel Animation" (null-terminated)
        fileType          : char[16]
        -- Always seems to be equal to 1
        unknown           : uint32
        -- Number of sections this file contains
        numSections       : uint32
        -- Always the same as numSections
        numSections2      : uint32
        -- Total size (in bytes) of all data in the section bodies
        bodySize          : uint32
        -- Unsure exactly what these mean (TODO)
        startPaletteRemap : uint8
        endPaletteRemap   : uint8
        -- Palette as packed RGB data.
        -- NOTE: These channels are 8bits deep, not 6 like the PAL files.
        palette           : uint8[256][3]
}

The bodySize field is very useful, if you skip this many bytes after the
section headers, then you will be at the start of the section tailers, which
contain information required to read the actual voxel data.

A VXL file can contain any number of named 'Sections' (also called 'Limbs').
Many of the RA2 vxls contain only one section.  I think the most complicated
example is the hmec.vxl, which contains 13 sections.

SectionHeader {
        -- Name of this section (null-terminated)
        name     : char[16]
        -- Section number, always seems to monotonically increase from 0
        number   : uint32
        unknown  : uint32
        unknown2 : uint32
}

SectionData {
        -- NOTE: n = SectionTailer.xSize * SectionTailer.ySize

        -- Offset into spanData to the start of each span
        -- NOTE: if == -1 then the span is empty (and has no span data)
        spanStart : int32[n]
        -- Offset into spanData to the end of each span
        -- NOTE: if == -1 then the span is empty (and has no span data)
        spanEnd   : int32[n]
        voxel     : VoxelSpan
}

VoxelSpan {
        -- Variable number of span segments to make up a whole span
        sections : VoxelSpanSegment[]
}

VoxelSpanSegment {
        -- Number of empty voxels before this span segment
        skip       : uint8
        -- Number of voxels in this span segment
        numVoxels  : uint8
        -- The voxels in the span segment
        voxels     : Voxel[numVoxels]
        -- Always equal to numVoxels
        numVoxels2 : uint8
}

Voxel {
        -- The colour of the voxel (to be looked up in a palette)
        colour : uint8
        -- The normal vector of the voxel
        normal : uint8
}

SectionTailer {
        -- Offset from the end of headers to the SectionData.spanStart array
        spanStartOffset : uint32
        -- Offset from the end of headers to the SectionData.spanEnd array
        spanEndOffset   : uint32
        -- Offset from the end of headers to the SectionData.voxelSpan data
        spanDataOffset  : uint32                      _
        -- The scaling factor (always seems to be 0.083)
        scale           : float
        -- The default transformation matrix for the section
        transform       : float[3][4]
        -- The bounding box of the section
        minBounds       : float[3]
        maxBounds       : float[3]
        -- The dimensions of the voxel object
        xSize           : uint8
        ySize           : uint8
        zSize           : uint8
        -- The type of normals (4 == Red Alert 2 normals)
        normalType      : uint8
}

****            -----=| VXL · Reading the voxel spans |=-----

Each voxel span represents a column of voxels, imagine a (SectionTailer.xSize x
SectionTailer.ySize) two dimensional grid, each cell of the grid contains one
column (span) of voxels, making a three dimensional block.  Some of the spans
are empty, and most of the other spans have a number of invisible voxels (this
is the purpose of the skip field in the VoxelSpanSegment).  These missing &
invisible voxels carve the final three dimensional image out of the solid
block.

Each voxel span is made up of multiple span sections.  The skip field of a
span section describes the distance between this section and the previous one,
which is empty.  The number of span sections is variable, and is zero if the
spanStart & spanEnd entries for the span equal -1.

The best way to read the voxel span (as used in the OS Voxel Tools) is to keep
count of the current z coordinate, and terminate as soon as it is greater than
or equal to the SectionTailer.zSize:

z    : uint8
s    : uint8
z = 0
while(z != SectionTailer.zSize) {
        with(VoxelSpanSegment[s]) {
                input >> .skip
                z += .skip
                if(z >= SectionTailer.zSize) {
                        break
                }
                input >> .numVoxels
                if(z + .numVoxels > SectionTailer.zSize) {
                        error()
                }
                for(i = 0 to .numVoxels - 1) {
                        input >> .voxel[i].colour
                        input >> .voxel[i].normal
                        z++
                }
                input >> .numVoxels2
                if(.numVoxels != .numVoxels2) {
                        error()
                }
        }
        s++
}

Some spans have a few bytes more data in them, but I assume it is just
garbage.  However this means you have to seek to the spanStart offset before
reading the span.

****                    -----=| VXL · Normals |=------

The normals in VXL files are stored a byte.  This byte is converted to a
normal using a process that I do not understand.  There is a lookup table
available in the OS Voxel Tools source code, and some normal tables on Olaf
van der Spek's website.

****                         -----=| HVA |=-----

A hva file describes an animation for a vxl file.  In the RA2 mix files a vxl
is always paired with a hva file of the same name (so hmec.vxl has hmec.hva).

HVAFile {
        header : Header
        frames : Frame[header.numFrames]
}

Header {
        -- Garbage, ignore (seems to be some part of a file path)
        fileName     : char[16]
        -- The number of frames the animation has
        numFrames    : uint32
        -- The number of sections that are animated
        numSections  : uint32
        -- The names of all the sections (null-terminated)
        sectionNames : char[numSections][16]
}

Frame {
        -- Transformation matrix for each section
        matrices : TMatrix[header.numSections]
}

TMatrix {
        -- The transformation matrix
        matrix : float[3][4]
}

The Header.fileName seems to be the first part of a path name, probably
something that was put in there by the conversion tool Westwood used.  It
seems to be safe to ignore completely.

The sectionNames correspond to the names in the VXL file.  You should really
use the names associate a transformation matrix with a section in VXL, but all
the vxl/hva pairs I've looked at have the sections in the same order.  So you
can probably get away with just assuming that the second section in the HVA
corresponds to the second section in the VXL etc.

The HVA format is very simple, just note that the matrices are stored in
section-fastest order.

****            -----=| HVA · Transformation Matrices |=-----

You will notice that the transformation matrices only have 3 rows, these are
the top three rows in a 4x4 marix, the bottom row is [0 0 0 1].

If you want to use these matrices with OpenGL then bear in mind that OpenGL
expects column-major matrices (C arrays are row-major).  So if you have a
16-element float array to pass to glMultMatrix, and you want to fill it in
with one of the matrices from a HVA or VXL file:

openGLMatrix[0]  = RA2Matrix[0][0]
openGLMatrix[1]  = RA2Matrix[1][0]
openGLMatrix[2]  = RA2Matrix[2][0]
openGLMatrix[3]  = 0
openGLMatrix[4]  = RA2Matrix[0][1]
openGLMatrix[5]  = RA2Matrix[1][1]
openGLMatrix[6]  = RA2Matrix[2][1]
openGLMatrix[7]  = 0
openGLMatrix[8]  = RA2Matrix[0][2]
openGLMatrix[9]  = RA2Matrix[1][2]
openGLMatrix[10] = RA2Matrix[2][2]
openGLMatrix[11] = 0
openGLMatrix[12] = RA2Matrix[0][3]
openGLMatrix[13] = RA2Matrix[1][3]
openGLMatrix[14] = RA2Matrix[2][3]
openGLMatrix[15] = 1

****              -----=| HVA · How to animate a VXL |=-----

For each section you need to:

- Calculate the ratio between screen units and voxels in all dimensions
from the fields in the SectionTailer:

sf : float[3]
with(SectionTailer) {
        sf[0] = (.maxBounds[0] - .minBounds[0]) / .xSize
        sf[1] = (.maxBounds[1] - .minBounds[1]) / .ySize
        sf[2] = (.maxBounds[2] - .minBounds[2]) / .zSize
}

This vector of scale factors is very important: you must scale all voxel
coordinates by these values before drawing.  So if you want to draw voxel
(x, y, z)
then you would draw it at coordinates
(x * sf[0], y * sf[1], z * sf[2])

- Create your transformation matrix.  There are two cases here:
-- Using a tranformation matrix from a HVA file
The translation column of the matrix has to be scaled.  There are two scale
factors that need to be applied; the SectionTailer.scale value and the sf
vector calculated above:

tm : float[3][4]
tm = HVAFile.frames[currentFrame].matrices[currentSection]
with(SectionTailer) {
        tm[0][3] *= .scale * sf[0]
        tm[1][3] *= .scale * sf[1]
        tm[2][3] *= .scale * sf[2]
}

-- Using the transformation matrix from the VXL SectionTailer
In this case the matrix is pre-scaled and can be used as-is.

- Get the minimum bounds from the SectionTailer
All voxel coordinates must be translated by these values, as this is the
origin for the section.

Example, using OpenGL:

glPushMatrix()

sf : float[3]
with(VXL.SectionTailer) {
        sf[0] = (.maxBounds[0] - .minBounds[0]) / .xSize
        sf[1] = (.maxBounds[1] - .minBounds[1]) / .ySize
        sf[2] = (.maxBounds[2] - .minBounds[2]) / .zSize
}

transform : float[16]
with(HVA.frame[currentFrame].matrices[currentSection]) {
        transform[0]  = .matrix[0][0]
        transform[1]  = .matrix[1][0]
        transform[2]  = .matrix[2][0]
        transform[3]  = 0
        transform[4]  = .matrix[0][1]
        transform[5]  = .matrix[1][1]
        transform[6]  = .matrix[2][1]
        transform[7]  = 0
        transform[8]  = .matrix[0][2]
        transform[9]  = .matrix[1][2]
        transform[10] = .matrix[2][2]
        transform[11] = 0
        transform[12] = .matrix[0][3] * VXL.SectionTailer.scale * sf[0]
        transform[13] = .matrix[1][3] * VXL.SectionTailer.scale * sf[1]
        transform[14] = .matrix[2][3] * VXL.SectionTailer.scale * sf[2]
        transform[15] = 1
}

glMultMatrix(transform)

with(VXL.SectionTailer) {
        glTranslatef(.minBounds[0], .minBounds[1], .minBounds[2])
}

for(x = 0 to VXL.SectionTailer.xSize) {
        for(y = 0 to VXL.SectionTailer.ySize) {
                for(z = 0 to VXL.SectionTailer.zSize) {
                        drawVoxel(x * sf[0], y * sf[1], z * sf[2])
                }
        }
}

glPopMatrix()

****                         -----=| PAL |=-----

Colour {
        r : uint8
        g : uint8
        b : uint8
}

PALFile {
        colours : Colour[256]
}

Palette files are used in most places that colours are used.  If a colour is
represented as a uint8, then it needs to be looked up in a palette, which
converts it into a three channel (RGB) colour value.

NOTE: All colour channels in PAL files only have a depth of 6 - only the low 6
bits of each channel are used.  Therefore to use these colours as 8bit per
channel colours (e.g. in 24bit images/textures) you should shift the rgb
values left 2, to place the 6 bits of colour information in the most
significant bits of the 8bit channels.

****                         -----=| SHP |=-----

The shp files in Red Alert contain the majority of the two dimensional images.
The urb, sno & tem files are a mixture of shp format files and tmp files.

****             -----=| SHP · Image Data Compression |=-----

There are three different types of image compression in the RA2 SHP files.
They are given the compressionType values of 1, 2, and 3.  Any other value is
an error.

Type 1 compression is uncompressed 8 bits-per-pixel image data.  There appears
to be files that call this type 0.

Type 2 compression is uncompressed data, but each scanline starts with a 16bit
length value.

Type 3 compression is the only compressionType that actually does any
compression.  The image is divided into scanlines, which all start with uint16
that specifies the length of the compressed scanline in bytes, including that
2 byte value.  The scanlines are RLE-zero compressed - only runs of zero bytes
are run-length-encoded.  All values except zeros are copied verbatim from the
input stream.  When a zero is encountered, the next byte is the number of
zeros in the run (so write that number of zeros to the output).

cBytes : uint16
b      : uint8
for(i = 0 to imgHeaders[n].h - 1) {
        /* Read number of bytes in scanline */
        input >> cBytes
        /* Take off the two bytes just read */
        cBytes -= 2

                        /* Copy non-zero bytes to output */
                        output << b
                } else {
                        /* Read number of encoded zeros */

                                output << 0x00
                        }
                }
        }
}

The output will contain raw 8 bits-per-pixel image data.

****                 -----=| SHP · Drawing a shp |=-----

Each image in the shp file can have a different size from the 'virtual' size
specified in the file header.  To draw an image from a shp file the image
should be drawn on an empty image of the 'virtual' size at the position
specified in the ImageHeader (ImagerHeader.x, ImageHeader.y).  This produces
homogeneously sized images, which will line up correctly for animations etc.

****                         -----=| TMP |=-----

The TMP files contain map 'templates.'  (Need more info on how these are
used).

In RA2 they have file extension urb, tem, or sno.  Beware though, some of
these files are shp files.

****                   -----=| TMP · The tiles |=-----

Each tile lies in an isometric grid.  A single tile of the grid is laid out
thus:

      \|                                                             
         <---------------------------60px--------------------------->

x - Tile origin (TileHeader.x, TileHeader.y)
· - A single pixel

Note that this diagram is distorted, as characters are taller than they are
wide.  Each isometric grid cell is twice as wide as it is tall.

Note that the bottom row of the tile is empty.

The tile data is not rectangular, which is why there is only 900 bytes of data
to fill a 30x60 pixel rectangle.  This is very important to remember when
drawing the tile onto a rectangular image.  A simple way to draw an isometric
tile onto a rectangular buffer is:

width     : uint32
pos       : uint32
tileWidth : uint32

width = 4
-- Always 60 for RA2
tileWidth = 60
for(y = 0 to 28) {
        pos = outStart + (tileWidth - width) / 2
        copy(output[pos], TileData.tile[tilePos], width)
        outStart += outWidth
        if(y < 15) {
                width += 4
        } else {
                width -= 4
        }
}

Where output is the rectangular buffer, outStart is initially set to the
origin of the tile in the buffer (the x in the diagram), and outWidth is the
total width of the output buffer.

All Y coordinates in the TileHeader (y & extraY) have to adjusted to take into
account the height of the tile.  Each height unit is a single isometric grid y
position upwards.  Bear in mind that these values increase as you move up the
template - the opposite to most graphics coordinates (usually 0,0 in top
left).  The easiest way to calculate the y offset in pixels for a tile is:

offset = (maxHeight - TileHeader.height) * (Header.tileHeight / 2)

where maxHeight is is maximum of all the height values in the template.  This
formula flips the height to correspond with the graphics orientation, ensuring
tiles with a higher height will be drawn above tiles with a lower height.
Also note that one isometric grid y position is half the tileHeight, as
demonstrated by this diagram:

                                   Grid  Height
                                  /\/\/\   3
                                  \/\/\/   2
                                  /\/\/\   1
                                  \/\/\/   0

****                 -----=| TMP · The extra data |=-----

Each tile can have an arbitrary sized 'extra' image associated with it (the
Extra data flag in the TileHeader.flags fields indicated whether this data is
present).  This image is a simple rectangular image, with dimensions given in
the TileHeader.  The position that the extra should be drawn at it also
specified in the header, this is an absolute position, not relative to the
tile.  Note that the y coordinate of the extra should be height adjusted in
the same way as the tile y coordinate.

****                -----=| TMP · The height data |=-----

No idea what this means, the XCC code & documentation refers to it as 'z' or
'height' data, so I assume it is some kind of height map.

****                         -----=| Map |=-----

The maps are stored as INI files.  This documentation will only cover the
format of the binary data sections - all the other keys are documented
extensively on ModEnc & Deezire's Editing Guide.  There are 4 sections that
contain binary data: PreviewPack, IsoMapPack5, OverlayPack, and
OverlayDataPack.

Binary sections are stored Base64 encoded (see RFC4648), then split into 70
character lines (the final line may be < 70 characters long), and each line
is used as the value for an incrementing number key, e.g.

[OverlayPack]

(Note the above is not a valid OverlayPack, just an example of what the data
looks like)

To decode, simply iterate sequentially over all the keys in the section, and
append all the values together.  This will form a valid Base64 encoded block
of binary data.  Remember that you can work out the length of the Base64
decoded data by:

outputLength = (inputLength / 4) * 3

where inputLength is the length of the Base64 encoded data (always an integral
multiple of 4), and outputLength is the length of the data once Base64
decoded.  All the following sections assume that the data has already been
extracted from the INI file and Base64 decoded.

****                  -----=| Map · Pack format |=-----

Once Base64 decoded the data is in the 'Pack' format (not sure where this name
comes from, seems to be what XCC calls it).

Pack {
        -- Variable number of sections, just keep reading them until they
        -- consume all the data
        sections : PackSection[]
}

PackSection {
        -- Length of the packedData
        compressedLength   : uint16
        -- Length of data when decompressed
        uncompressedLength : uint16
        -- Compressed data
        packedData         : uint8[compressedLength]
}

The packed data is compressed using one of two compression methods depending
on which INI section it is:

LZO - IsoMapPack5 & PreviewPack
Format80 - OverlayPack & OverlayDataPack

To make the final binary each section of the pack must be decompressed using
the appropriate method and concatenated together.

****             -----=| Map · Pack compression · LZO |=-----

In this case the packedData is compressed using the LZO1X algorithm (see
http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/).  There nice little library called
minilzo that contains everything required to decompress the data. 

****          -----=| Map · Pack compression · Format80 |=-----

In this case the packedData is compressed using the somewhat complex Format80
encoding used in the old (RA/TD) SHP files.  This format is so named as all
Format80 encoded binaries end with the 0x80 byte.

The Format80 encoding consists of 5 commands, and there are 3 operations that
these commands can perform:

 - Copy a number of bytes from a position in the output to the output (note
   that these areas often overlap)
   copy(number of bytes, position)
 - Copy a number of bytes from the input to the output
   copyFromIn(number of bytes)
 - Write a number of copies of a specified byte to the output
   fill(number of bytes, byte)

The 5 commands are:
                Command (binary)                           Operation
10cc cccc                                             copyFromIn(c)
1111 1110  cccc cccc  cccc cccc  wwww wwww            fill(c, w)
0ccc rrrr  rrrr rrrr                                  copy(c + 3, outPos - r)
11cc cccc  pppp pppp  pppp pppp                       copy(c + 3, p)
1111 1111  cccc cccc  cccc cccc  pppp pppp pppp pppp  copy(c, p)

outPos is the current position in the output buffer.

A Format80 encoded block is always terminated by a 0x80 command (copy 0 bytes
from input).

I won't go into more detail about this format as an excellent explanation and
example code is available in "The Red Alert File Formats Guide" by Gavin Pugh.

****                  -----=| Map · PreviewPack |=-----

PreviewPack {
        -- Raw RGB image data
        -- previewWidth & previewHeight can be read from the INI file
        image : uint8[previewHeight * previewWidth][3]
}

The PreviewPack is the simplest of the sections addressed, once decompressed
it is a raw 24bits-per-pixel RGB image.  The dimensions of the image are given
in the [Preview] section (Size key).

****                  -----=| Map · IsoMapPack5 |=-----

IsoMapPack {
        -- Defines each tile on the map
        entries : IsoEntry[]

IsoEntry {
        -- Position of tile (CHECK SIGNEDNESS)
        x       : uint16
        y       : uint16

        z       : uint8
        -- Padding
        zero2   : uint8
}

I don't know what ID corresponds to what tile yet.
