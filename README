This package consists of the Red Alert 2 file format description and the C++
programs I wrote to read the described formats.  See the introduction of the
ra2ff.txt file for more info.

The VXL renderer/animator is probably the most interesting part of this, it's
very simple and slow, but hopefully the code is clear.

# Requirements
 - Linux with a compiler / GNU make (not tested windows)
 - SDL, SDL_gfx and SDL_image

The Exception header file uses variadic macros, which is not part of the C++
standard (it's C99) so GCC will warn you about it.

# Licence
I have released this under the GPLv2 as I think it is compatible with the
licences of all the open source projects which I used as a reference.  Different
licence terms may be possible if required.

# MiniLZO
I've included the required files from MiniLZO to decompress the LZO compressed
map sections.  MiniLZO is GPL licensed, see include/minilzo.h for more
information.
